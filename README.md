## Srikaanth Thalanki Balajhi <a href="https://srikaanth.com/">My website</a>

A young aspiring software developer who recently graduated from makers academy with a passion to seek out the next big thing. Having done an apprenticeship in IT skills and going futher to gain an MTA in networking as well as a wealth of past experience as a web-developer, I'd be a perfect fit for any dev team. I'm able to hit the ground running, communicate effectivly both in person and remotely to techies and non-techies alike and adapt quickly to any new challenge.

#### Skills
**Web developement**
I have 4 years of experience of developing websites using wordpress. Examples of my work: <a href="https://www.dogs.co.uk/">Dogs.co.uk</a>, <a href="https://www.pfca.org.uk/">PFCA</a>, <a href="https://www.expatriates.co.uk/">Expatriates</a>

**Adaptable**
Halfway through the makers academy course, it suddenly switched to an online only format due to the COVID pandemic. This brought with it its own challenges, on top of learning new languages, I had to quickly adapt to pair programming remotely, as well as co-ordinate working in groups. Having been able to product a clone of facebook and airbnb in a short amount of time while grounding myself in completly new technologies to me along the way, I can safely say that I have proven myself to be adaptable.
