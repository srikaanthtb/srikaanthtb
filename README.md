An aspiring software developer with a passion to seek out the next big thing. After leaving school, decided University wasn't for me and decided to do an apprenticeship as a web developer. Over that time I learned a lot about web technology and then I decided I wanted more. So here I am at makers academy!

I want to become a full fledged software developer and always be seeking that next big thing in a industry that constantly changes
